## Fundamentals

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues for `samplecount/methcla`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Uses the default five-role vocabulary (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout: one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Workflows

- Create PRs for non-trivial changes. This allows reviewing code and running actions before merging.
- Create PR branches before submitting a PR or when prompted to submit changes to a PR branch.
- For small, low-risk changes, or when prompted to do so, commit directly to develop.
- Before committing changes or submitting PRs, build locally and run tests.
- When merging PRs via gh, update the working copy accordingly (pull and delete PR branch).
- Keep PR branch name descriptive but short. No prefixes like `feat/`. Dashes: `my-awesome-new-feature`.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the human-facing version of these workflows.

## Domain and API references

- Use the domain language in `CONTEXT.md`; avoid the listed synonyms.
- Before changing build structure or dependencies, check `docs/adr/` for prior decisions.
- When working with synth, node, or bus commands, consult `docs/osc-api.md`.
- For audio routing and node tree structure, see `docs/architecture.md`.
